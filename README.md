# ePortfolio-Generator

This is a pretty intuitive Java desktop app. The GUI is made in FX. 

#What it does

Allows a user to input specifications, creating and saving these as projects, which will ultimately lead up to a generated HTML project. The user may view 
their pages as actual HTML as they progress in their project. 

#How it does it

Projects are saved into JSON files (and loaded back). Web stuff is HTML5&CSS3 with Javscript and Jquery, obviously.
